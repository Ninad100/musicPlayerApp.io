# Music Player Application

This is Front-end web application. The application is designed to use as Music player system for web based clients.
No third party libraries are used. Code is purely based on **HTML, CSS and Vanila Javascript**.

The Hosted link for application is as below:


## Features
1. Play the song
2. Filter the song based on Genre
3. Search the song
4. Add a Song to the PlayList.
5. Remove the song from the Playlist
6. Search the playlist
7. Dark mode enabler for the night time.
8. Normal Audio controls to play the next and Previous songs.

### The songs present in this github were downloaded from Youtube. This just used for learning and development because for me links were not working directly.
